This game is nowhere near perfect, but I made it my first time using claude in around 2 hours. The UI feels a little janky, looking slightly off as well as the stats displaying as percentages (which they're not) and the buttons taking two clicks to work.
That is also not to mention that the gameplay is nothing remarkable. That being said, these issues could be fixed in half an hour to an hour if I cared enough to continue this project, as it was just a proof of concept for my own entertainment.
To play, you need Python 3.13, and make sure to enable environmental variables/PATH when installing. Then if you don't already have pygame, using command prompt type "pip install pygame". Then, just click the Code button on github, install the zip, extract it, and run the .py file.
Enjoy.
