This game is nowhere near perfect, but I made it my first time using claude in around 2 hours. The UI feels a little janky, looking slightly off as well as the stats displaying as percentages (which they're not) and the buttons taking two clicks to work.
That is also not to mention that the gameplay is nothing remarkable. That being said, these issues could be fixed in half an hour to an hour I'm sure, if I cared enough to continue this project, as it was just a proof of concept for my own entertainment.
Enjoy.
